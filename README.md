# Evade

Evade is a Java Game I'm making for fun. If you somehow discovered that, I'm sorry for bad code, but would appreciate any suggestions to make it better. This game is still kind of a learning process for me.

What I allow you to do with my code? This game is licenced with the MIT licence. For details, see the license file in the repository.
